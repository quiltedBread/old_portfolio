      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        As a lifelong scientist, before tech I researched human genetics,
        analyzed protein structures, and designed PCR tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2019, I transitioned from research to a clinical laboratory. I
        quickly absorbed new concepts while discovering areas ripe for
        automation. Utilizing tech to improve others' experience quickly
        developed into a passion.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, I'm usually running, testing out a new recipe, or
        over-engineering my garden.
